# Fake Review Detection

## Project Description
This project detects **fake or misleading product reviews** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning models**. It analyzes review text to classify reviews as genuine or fake, helping consumers make informed decisions and reducing the impact of fraudulent reviews.

## Key Features
- Text preprocessing and cleaning for review datasets
- Fine-tuned NLP models (e.g., DistilBERT) for classification
- Evaluation using **F1-score, Precision, Recall, and Accuracy**
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance
